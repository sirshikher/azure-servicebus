  /**
   * Create a RemoteReplicatorStatus.
   * @property {string} [replicaId] Represents the replica ID of the remote
   * secondary replicator.
   * @property {date} [lastAcknowledgementProcessedTimeUtc] The last timestamp
   * (in UTC) when an acknowledgement from the secondary replicator was
   * processed on the primary.
   * UTC 0 represents an invalid value, indicating that no acknowledgement
   * messages were ever processed.
   * @property {string} [lastReceivedReplicationSequenceNumber] The highest
   * replication operation sequence number that the secondary has received from
   * the primary.
   * @property {string} [lastAppliedReplicationSequenceNumber] The highest
   * replication operation sequence number that the secondary has applied to
   * its state.
   * @property {boolean} [isInBuild] A value that indicates whether the
   * secondary replica is in the process of being built.
   * @property {string} [lastReceivedCopySequenceNumber] The highest copy
   * operation sequence number that the secondary has received from the
   * primary.
   * A value of -1 implies that the secondary has received all copy operations.
   * @property {string} [lastAppliedCopySequenceNumber] The highest copy
   * operation sequence number that the secondary has applied to its state.
   * A value of -1 implies that the secondary has applied all copy operations
   * and the copy process is complete.
   * @property {object} [remoteReplicatorAcknowledgementStatus] Represents the
   * acknowledgment status for the remote secondary replicator.
   * @property {object}
   * [remoteReplicatorAcknowledgementStatus.replicationStreamAcknowledgementDetail]
   * Details about the acknowledgements for operations that are part of the
   * replication stream data.
   * @property {string}
   * [remoteReplicatorAcknowledgementStatus.replicationStreamAcknowledgementDetail.averageReceiveDuration]
   * Represents the average duration it takes for the remote replicator to
   * receive an operation.
   * @property {string}
   * [remoteReplicatorAcknowledgementStatus.replicationStreamAcknowledgementDetail.averageApplyDuration]
   * Represents the average duration it takes for the remote replicator to
   * apply an operation. This usually entails writing the operation to disk.
   * @property {string}
   * [remoteReplicatorAcknowledgementStatus.replicationStreamAcknowledgementDetail.notReceivedCount]
   * Represents the number of operations not yet received by a remote
   * replicator.
   * @property {string}
   * [remoteReplicatorAcknowledgementStatus.replicationStreamAcknowledgementDetail.receivedAndNotAppliedCount]
   * Represents the number of operations received and not yet applied by a
   * remote replicator.
   * @property {object}
   * [remoteReplicatorAcknowledgementStatus.copyStreamAcknowledgementDetail]
   * Details about the acknowledgements for operations that are part of the
   * copy stream data.
   * @property {string}
   * [remoteReplicatorAcknowledgementStatus.copyStreamAcknowledgementDetail.averageReceiveDuration]
   * Represents the average duration it takes for the remote replicator to
   * receive an operation.

   * [remoteReplicatorAcknowledgementStatus.copyStreamAcknowledgementDetail.averageApplyDuration]
   * Represents the average duration it takes for the remote replicator to
